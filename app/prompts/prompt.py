def landing_page_prompt() -> PromptTemplate:
    return PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["position", "persona","target", "agent_scratchpad"], 
        template="""
      You are a world-class SaaS copywriter tasked with creating a high-converting landing page:
      Consider the following inputs:
      ## Input:
      ### Company's positioning statement: {position}
      ### Persona Profile: {persona}
      ### target_channel: {target}

      ##  YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT (Section-by-Section):

      ### 1. Hero Section
      - **Header** (6 to 12 words): Specific, bold. What the product does and who it is for.
      - **Subheader** (10 to 13 words): Explain how it works. No fluff.
      - **Primary CTA**: Action-driven text (e.g., “Start organizing my day”)

      Example:
      > Header: “Plan your day with AI — crush chaos in minutes”  
      > Subheader: “TaskNest auto-prioritizes your to-do list based on urgency, deadlines, and energy levels.”  
      > CTA: “Try TaskNest Free”

      ---

      ### 2. Features & Objection Handling (Write 3 to 4 Feature Blocks)
      For each feature:
      - **Title** (3 to 5 words): Clear benefit
      - **Paragraph**:
        - Start with the problem
        - Explain the implication
        - Present your solution bluntly
      - Write in second-person (“you”), and be direct
      - Address a common objection in each block where possible

      Example:
      > Title: “Smart Task Assignment”  
      > Paragraph: You waste hours deciding what to do next. That indecision kills momentum. TaskNest picks your top priorities automatically — based on urgency, energy, and deadlines.

      ---

      ### 3. Social Proof Section
      - Include 1 to 2 strong testimonials near the top (quote + attribution)
      - Include micro-proof quotes near the features or CTAs
      - Mention logos or brand names if relevant (even early-stage fake social proof is acceptable)

      Example:
      > “Helped us ship 30 percent faster in our first week.” — Angela R., Product Manager at Zapier  
      > Logos: [Zapier], [Webflow], [Linear]

      ---

      ### 4. CTAs (At least 2 more throughout the page)
      - Match CTA wording to the benefit discussed in the previous section
      - Add mid-page and bottom CTAs
      - Keep buttons short and action-focused (no “Click here”)

      Example:
      > After a feature about reducing stress:  
      > CTA: “Calm my calendar”

      ---

      ### 5. Visual Suggestions (Text-only — no images required)
      For each major section, suggest:
      - A screenshot, GIF, or product visual to pair with it
      - Must be literal (e.g., show UI), not conceptual graphics

      Example:
      > - Hero section: Screencast of daily planner auto-filling  
      > - Feature 2: GIF showing a task being reassigned automatically  
      > - CTA block: Static image with before/after checklist

      ---

      ## Style Guidelines:
      - Use plain language
      - Avoid jargon
      - Keep it scannable (short paragraphs, direct sentences)
      - No buzzwords like “disruptive,” “synergy,” “cutting-edge”
      - Speak to one person (second-person “you”)
      - Stay on tone: match the brand's tone provided in the inputs

      ---

      ## Final Output:
      Return a full landing page draft broken into labeled sections, with copy and visual suggestions clearly separated. Do not include HTML or markdown formatting — just structured, clean content blocks for each section.

      ---

      Do not invent features or testimonials beyond what's provided. If a required input is missing, raise a warning instead of making assumptions.

        template= """You are a world-class paid social copywriter and performance ad strategist.

Your task is to generate high-performing ad copy for Instagram/Facebook and TikTok, based on:

- The user persona (pain points, behaviors, and objections)
- The specific characteristics and best practices of each platform

You are provided
- Positioning Kit: {position}
- Persona Profile: {persona}
- Target Channel: {target}

---

## For Instagram & Facebook:

Write ad copy that maximizes **scannability, clarity, and instant value recognition**.

### What to include:
1. **Creative Copy (3 to 7 words)**  
   - Must be visual-first and thumb-stopping  
   - Should clearly convey the biggest outcome or value prop  
   - Avoid vague phrases like “Get started” — instead say “Organize your day in 5 minutes” or “AI writes your emails for you”

2. **Headline (5 to 10 words)**  
   - Use sharp, direct language  
   - Focus on outcomes (“Write better tweets, faster”)  
   - Avoid generic fluff (“Boost productivity” is not enough)

3. **Body Copy**  
   Write 3 variations:
   - **Short**: Under 150 characters. Hook-focused. Speaks directly to a pain point or outcome.
   - **Medium**: 150 to 250 characters. Add credibility, highlight a key feature, include light CTA.
   - **Long**: For cold audiences. Use a micro-story: Introduce a problem, explain the cost of inaction, present your solution, and end with a CTA. Keep it punchy and human.

4. **Social Proof**  
   - Include 1 testimonial, statistic, or quote (real or stylized placeholder if none provided)
   - Add recognizable brand logos if available
   - Place micro-quotes near the CTA copy when possible

5. **Carousel Suggestions (if applicable)**  
   - Provide 2 to 3 short captions for use in a carousel format  
   - Each caption should represent a single value prop or solved pain point  
   - Focus on sequencing from awareness → problem → solution

### Tone & Style:
- Match brand tone (e.g., calm, bold, quirky)
- Use second-person (“you”) to speak directly to the viewer
- Make the benefit instantly clear without reading twice
- CTA should be action-oriented: “Try free”, “Get my dashboard”, “Start automating now”

---

## For TikTok:

Write ad copy in the form of a **15 to 30 second native-feel video script**.

TikTok is not a platform for polished brand ads — it's for **story-driven, UGC-style, creator-led content**.

### What to include:
1. **Hook (0 to 3s)**  
   - Must stop the scroll: either an unexpected statement, dramatic question, or visual metaphor  
   - Example: “You're doing your to-do list all wrong…”  
   - Overlay TikTok-native text and motion to reinforce the hook

2. **Pain Point & Quick Intro (3 to 8s)**  
   - Show the relatable problem the user faces  
   - Transition immediately to how the product helps without a hard pitch  
   - Keep it casual and conversational

3. **Demo or Transformation (8 to 20s)**  
   - Show or describe what life looks like **with the product**  
   - Use humor, contrast, or visuals to reinforce transformation  
   - Be literal — avoid abstract metaphors

4. **CTA (20 to 30s)**  
   - Close with a soft, native-feel CTA  
   - Example: “I've saved 2 hours a day since switching — link's in bio”  
   - Bonus: mention urgency, exclusivity, or discount if applicable

5. **Creator Brief (if Spark Ad)**  
   - Include 2to 3 talking points (value props or pain points)  
   - Suggested tone (e.g., confident, chaotic, sarcastic)  
   - Do's and don'ts: “Don't sound corporate”, “Use slang your audience uses”, “Include the glitch transition”

###  Visual & Editorial Style:
- Use TikTok-native captions (avoid overlays that scream “ad”)  
- Start with motion (e.g., face, hand gesture, screen tap)  
- Avoid polished B-roll — lean into raw, relatable content  
- Reference known creators if possible (e.g., “This should feel like a Duolingo-style creator, chaotic + casual”)

If any input is missing, make the best assumption.

Your copy will be used for performance testing. Prioritize **clarity, relatability, and scroll-stopping specificity** over cleverness or fluff.

## INPUTS:
- Target customer profile: {target_customer}
- Competitor Price: {competitor_price}
- Cost structure: {cost_structure}

---

## YOUR TASK:
Step 1: Analyze the Pricing Environment

Evaluate the product's features, value, and differentiation — is it mission-critical, feature-rich, or a commodity?

Then, assess promotion strategy: Is it product-led, sales-led, or heavily discounted? What kind of pricing communication is needed?

Finally, consider distribution (place): Is the product sold via API, mobile app, desktop SaaS, or direct sales? Local vs. global?

Use these 3Ps to determine how much flexibility, transparency, and scalability your pricing model needs.

Step 2: Recommend a Pricing Structure
Choose the most appropriate pricing structure:
- Usage-Based
- Tiered
- Flat-Rate
- Per-User
- Variable/Custom

Explain:
- Why this model fits the product and market
- What customer behavior or expectation it aligns with

Step 3: Recommend a Pricing Methodology
Choose one of the following methods:
- Value-Based
- Cost-Plus
- Competitor-Based

Explain:
- Why this method makes sense at the current stage
- What data is (or isn’t) available to support it
- Any tradeoffs or risks involved

Step 4: Strategic Add-ons
If applicable, suggest:
- Discounting strategies
- Freemium offers
- Bundling strategies
- Psychological pricing tactics

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Recommended Pricing Structure: [Structure] — [Justification]
2. Recommended Pricing Methodology: [Method] — [Justification]
3. Add-on Strategies: [Optional ideas]
4. Estimated Starting Price Range: [Your proposal, even if high-level]

Remember:
- Avoid over-complicating unless needed
- Justify based on customer segment, product type, and JTBD fit
- Default to clarity and relevance
